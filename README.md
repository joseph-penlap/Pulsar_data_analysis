# Pulsar data analysis
The data used for this study, consists of statistical properties of signals from the universe which are meant to be used to predict if they originate from a **Pulsar Star**.

# Work description
In this group project, we aims to figure out an appropriate **ANN (Artificial Neural Network)** for a given classification dataset. The outline of the work is described below.
1. Explain the dataset, i.e., indicate the number of observations, describe the given features, describe what is supposed to be predicted, etc.
2. Pre-process the data, i.e., consider issues as balanced/imbalanced data during in this step, remove redundant features, convert categorical variables to numerical variables, apply an appropriate
standardization, etc.
3. Design and implement an ANN for the given classification task in your dataset.
4. Evaluate the performance of your model by examining the test and training losses.
5. Implement the l1-regularizer, l2-regularizer and dropout layers and compare the model perfor-
mance to the original modelâ€™s performance. Explain the observations.
6. Propose a concept with which you can infer the amount of influence of an input feature to the target value.
